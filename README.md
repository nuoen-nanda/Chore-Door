# Chore-Door
Hello! This is my first project of combining HTML, CSS and Javascript together to make a simple game I learnt on Codecademy! ðŸ’–âœ¨
I uploaded this using command line by following the tutorial videos by The Coding Trainâœ¨âœ¨
I'm so excited!
Hope you guys enjoy this simple game! ðŸ’–

(there's an imperfection though, my branch is master instead of main as I didn't know how to change it previously... until I watched the tutorial videos! 
So I will make sure my files are on "main" instead of "master" next time!)
